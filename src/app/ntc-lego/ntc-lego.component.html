          This was the capstone project for my associates degree at Northcentral
          Technical College. NTC Lego is a inventory management system used to
          manage inventory, orders, and sales. My role in this project was
          Front-end Developer and Designer. Our team consisted of 5 people, 4
          software developers and me as the lone web designer. Our instructor
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominicg/" target="_blank"
            >Dominic Gruetzmacher</a
          >
          held the roles of Product Manager and Client. We worked using Agile
          methodology and were able to finish the project in 5 sprints. A
          Stakeholder meeting and 5 report outs were conducted throughout the
          period of the class. Dominic was able to give us great insight on this
          application because he owns the biggest lego business in the United
          States. We had the chance to meet with his personal team that has a
          real life application extremely similar to this project. Blazor and
          ASP.Net were utilized as the stack for this application.

          <h5>Sprint 1</h5>
          <p>
            For the first sprint I created a specification document that
            included business goals, a site map, a style guide, 3rd Party APIs,
            and the Demographics. I also hand drew some wireframes that we
            reviewed together as a team. I took the modifications and input from
            those and put them digitally into Figma for us to reference.

            In the second sprint I cleaned up the wireframes a little bit more
            for the team and I focused on shared views that would be re-used
            throughout the pages. The style/functionality of the header and side
            nav was created by me.

            In sprint 3, I styled the tables used to display data while also
            plugging in the data to them. I also started laying some foundation
            for the admin dashboard, which is one of the main pages to be used.

            This sprint for me was all about the admin dashboard. I needed to
            rewrite a lot of the functionality because of the three main tables
            on the page. I also worked with team members to get backend
            functionality solved. This was the most challenging sprint for me
            because of the data work needed for this page.

            By the time we hit this last sprint most of the hard work was done.
            We focused mainly on cleanup work to polish this project off. I
            worked mostly on re-styling the UI to make it more user friendly.

          <p>
            Overall, I was really happy with what our team was able to achieve
            in 1 semester. There is a lot of work we could have added, but we
            achieved the functionality our product client was looking for. There
            was also a compliment on the UI being very user friendly and easy to
            use, which was my goal as a front-end developer and designer.
