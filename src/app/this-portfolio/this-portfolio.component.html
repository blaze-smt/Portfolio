          Welcome to my portfolio website. I keep track of my creative projects
          here. It took a lot of trial and error to get to this point, but in
          the end im very happy with it and I think it represents me well.
          During the Summer of 2022 I had a personal goal of designing a mobile
          landing page everyday. I was able to do it for 5 months straight. This
          experience was good because my skills in mobile design were improved
          and it also got me more familiar with Figma. The last design I created
          for that project was a mobile view for this portfolio. I wasnâ€™t sure
          if I wanted to take the work of redoing my portfolio over again, but I
          liked that little mockup so much I had to do it. This final version
          was spontaneously started on August 13th, 2022.
