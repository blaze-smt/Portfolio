          Welcome to my portfolio website. I keep track of my creative projects
          here. It took a lot of trial and error to get to this point, but in
          the end im very happy with it and I think it represents me well.
          During the Summer of 2022 I had a personal goal of designing a mobile
          landing page everyday. I was able to do it for 5 months straight. This
          experience was good because my skills in mobile design were improved
          and it also got me more familiar with Figma. The last design I created
          for that project was a mobile view for this portfolio. I wasnâ€™t sure
          if I wanted to take the work of redoing my portfolio over again, but I
          liked that little mockup so much I had to do it. this final version
          was spontaneously started on August 13th, 2022.

            I started by determining my target demographic. To do that I made up
            personas and scenarios for employers, clients, and fellow creatives.
            This gave me a good idea of the type of content I needed to show on
            here.

            The Specification Document is where I lay out business goals,
            website functionality, the site map, 3rd Party APIs, etc... This
            finalizes the purpose of the website and what I need to achieve
            that.

          <h1>Wireframes</h1>
          <p>
            When I start my wireframe process I like to hand draw them because
            its a lot faster and easier to revise. When I feel comfortable with
            those drawings, I translate them onto Figma. The wireframes give me
            a good idea of what the mockups/Prototypes should look like.
