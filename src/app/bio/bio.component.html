        <h3>BIO</h3>
        <p>
          I am an Oneida citizen and first-descendant of the Stockbridge-Munsee
          Mohican Tribal Nation. My schooling at UW-Milwaukee started in spring
          2023 for a Bachelor’s in Information Science and Technology. Web
          design is what I studied at Northcentral Technical College in Wausau,
          WI, where I graduated with an associate’s degree. While studying
          full-time, I am also interning at Associated Bank, working under the
          Innovation & Design team. On the side, I work as a web design
          consultant through independent contracts. Currently, I am 23 years old
          and based out of Milwaukee, WI.
