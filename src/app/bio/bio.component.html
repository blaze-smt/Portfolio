        <h3>BIO</h3>
        <p>
          I am an Oneida citizen and first-descendant of the Stockbridge-Munsee
          Mohican Tribal Nation. My schooling at UW-Milwaukee starts in Spring
          2024 for a Bachelor’s in Information Science and Technology. Web
          design is what I studied at Northcentral Technical College in Wausau,
          WI, where I graduated with an associate’s degree. While studying
          full-time, I also work as a web design consultant through independent
          contracts. Currently I am 22 years old, based out of Milwaukee, WI.
